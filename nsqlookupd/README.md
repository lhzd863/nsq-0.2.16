nsqlookupd
==========

`nsqlookupd` is the daemon that manages topology information. Clients query `nsqlookupd` to lookup `nsqd` locations for
a specific topic, and `nsqd` broadcasts topic and channel information.

There are two interfaces: A TCP interface which is used by nsqd for broadcasts, and a HTTP interface for clients to
perform discovery.

The HTTP interface has the following API endpoints

 * `/lookup?topic=....`
 * `/topics`
 * `/delete_channel?topic=...&channel=...`
 * `/ping` (returns "OK" for use with monitoring)
 * `/info` returns server version information.
