# NSQ Changelog

## Binaries

### 0.2.16 - 2013-01-07

**Upgrading from 0.2.15**: there are no backward incompatible changes in this release.

However, this release introduces the `IDENTIFY` command (which supersedes sending 
metadata along with `SUB`) for clients of `nsqd`.  The old functionality will be 
removed in a future release.

 * #114 persist paused channels through restart
 * #121 fix typo preventing compile of bench_reader (thanks @datastream)
 * #120 fix nsqd crash when empty command is sent (thanks @michaelhood)
 * #115 nsq_to_file --filename-format --datetime-format parameter and fix
 * #101 fix topic/channel delete operations ordering
 * #98 nsqadmin fixes when not using lookupd
 * #90/#108 performance optimizations / IDENTIFY protocol support in nsqd. For 
   a single consumer of small messages (< 4k) increases throughput ~400% and 
   reduces # of allocations ~30%.

## Go Client Library

### 0.3.0 - 2013-01-07

**Upgrading from 0.2.4**: There are no backward incompatible changes to applications
written against the public `nsq.Reader` API.

However, there *are* a few backward incompatible changes to the API for applications that 
directly use other public methods, or properties of a few NSQ data types:

`nsq.Message` IDs are now a type `nsq.MessageID` (a `[16]byte` array).  The signatures of
`nsq.Finish()` and `nsq.Requeue()` reflect this change.

`nsq.SendCommand()` and `nsq.Frame()` were removed in favor of `nsq.SendFramedResponse()`.

`nsq.Subscribe()` no longer accepts `shortId` and `longId`.  If upgrading your consumers
before upgrading your `nsqd` binaries to `0.2.16-rc.1` they will not be able to send the 
optional custom identifiers.
    
 * #90 performance optimizations
 * #81 reader performance improvements / MPUB support

### 0.2.4 - 2012-10-15

 * #69 added IsStarved() to reader API

### 0.2.3 - 2012-10-11

 * #64 timeouts on reader queries to lookupd
 * #54 fix crash issue with reader cleaning up from unexpectedly closed nsqd connections
