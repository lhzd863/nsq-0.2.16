**NSQ** is a realtime message processing system designed to operate at bitly's scale, handling
billions of messages per day.

It promotes *distributed* and *decentralized* topologies [without single points of failure][spof],
enabling fault tolerance and high availability coupled with a reliable [message delivery
guarantee][message_guarantee].

Operationally, **NSQ** is easy to configure and deploy (all parameters are specified on the command
line and compiled binaries have no runtime dependencies). For maximum flexibility, it is agnostic to
data format (messages can be JSON, [MsgPack][msgpack], [Protocol Buffers][go-protobuf], or anything
else). Official Go and Python libraries are available out of the box and, if you're interested in
building your own client, there's a [protocol spec][protocol] (see [client libraries](#client)).

The latest stable release is **[0.2.16][latest_tag]**. We publish [binary releases][binary] for
linux and darwin.

NOTE: master is our *development* branch and may *not* be stable at all times.

[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/bitly/nsq.png)](http://travis-ci.org/bitly/nsq)

## Why?

**NSQ** was built as a successor to [simplequeue][simplequeue] (part of [simplehttp][simplehttp])
and as such was designed to (in no particular order):

 * provide easy topology solutions that enable high-availability and eliminate SPOFs
 * address the need for stronger message delivery guarantees
 * bound the memory footprint of a single process (by persisting some messages to disk)
 * greatly simplify configuration requirements for producers and consumers
 * provide a straightforward upgrade path
 * improve efficiency

If you're interested in more of the design, history, and evolution please read our [design
doc][design] or [blog post][nsq_post].

* [nsq][nsq] Go (official)
* [pynsq][pynsq] Python (official) [pypi][pynsq_pypi]
* [libnsq][libnsq] C

## Additional Documentation

**NSQ** is composed of the following individual components, each with their own README:

 * [nsqd][nsqd] is the daemon that receives, buffers, and delivers messages to clients.
 * [nsqlookupd][nsqlookupd] is the daemon that manages topology information
 * [nsqadmin][nsqadmin] is the web UI to view message statistics and perform administrative tasks
 * [nsq][nsq] is a go package for writing `nsqd` clients

As well as the following documents in the [docs][docs] directory:

 * [Design][design] - in-depth overview of how and why
 * [Patterns][patterns] - implementation solutions for various use cases
 * [Protocol Spec][protocol] - technical details for the `nsqd` protocol

### Performance

DISCLAIMER: Please keep in mind that NSQ is designed to be used in a distributed fashion. Single
node performance is important, but not the end-all-be-all of what we're looking to achieve. Also,
benchmarks are stupid, but here's a few anyway to ignite the flame:

On a 2012 MacBook Air i7 2ghz (`GOMAXPROCS=1`, `go tip 8bbc0bdf832e`) single publisher, single consumer:

```
$ ./nsqd --mem-queue-size=100000

$ ./bench_writer --num=100000
2013/01/06 17:24:38 duration: 310.575793ms - 61.413mb/s - 321982.596ops/s - 3.106us/op

$ ./bench_reader --num=100000
2013/01/06 17:25:47 duration: 672.059087ms - 28.381mb/s - 148796.441ops/s - 6.721us/op
```

### Getting Started

The following steps will run **NSQ** on your local machine and walk through publishing, consuming,
and archiving messages to disk.

 1. follow the instructions in the [INSTALLING][installing] doc (or [download a binary
    release][binary]).
 2. in one shell, start `nsqlookupd`:
        
        $ nsqlookupd

 3. in another shell, start `nsqd`:

        $ nsqd --lookupd-tcp-address=127.0.0.1:4160

 4. in another shell, start `nsqadmin`:

        $ nsqadmin --lookupd-http-address=127.0.0.1:4161

 5. publish an initial message (creates the topic in the cluster, too):
 
        $ curl -d 'hello world 1' 'http://127.0.0.1:4151/put?topic=test'

 6. finally, in another shell, start `nsq_to_file`:

        $ nsq_to_file --topic=test --output-dir=/tmp --lookupd-http-address=127.0.0.1:4161

 7. publish more messages to `nsqd`:

        $ curl -d 'hello world 2' 'http://127.0.0.1:4151/put?topic=test'
        $ curl -d 'hello world 3' 'http://127.0.0.1:4151/put?topic=test'

 8. to verify things worked as expected, in a web browser open `http://127.0.0.1:4171/` to view 
    the `nsqadmin` UI and see statistics.  Also, check the contents of the log files (`test.*.log`) 
    written to `/tmp`.

The important lesson here is that `nsq_to_file` (the client) is not explicitly told where the `test`
topic is produced, it retrieves this information from `nsqlookupd` and, despite the timing of the
connection, no messages are lost.
